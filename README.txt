Ludum Dare 14 Entry, early version (15:22 into compo). By Mike Tsao.

Requirements: Python 2.5, pygame

To run: start src/ld14.py from the same directory as this readme. The reason for this is that the Python program expects to be able to find assets/ in the current directory. Sorry for the hassle -- I'll package it up better.

How to play: click on four tiles to move them to the slots. If the four slots are either all the same shape or all the same color, they're removed from play. Don't let the wall make it to the bottom of the screen.

To do:

- Scoring
- Animation
- Sound
- In-game tutorial

Gameplay adjustment:

- Way too much clicking right now. Is there an easier way to do the UI?
- Too hard -- there are too many tiles for the rate of wall advancement.
- Kind of boring, as expected.
