Requirements to run:

- Windows
- High pain threshold -OR- the forgiving mind of a child

Resources used:

- Python 2.5 http://www.python.org/
- pygame http://www.pygame.org/
- A text editor
- Microsoft Paint
- DrPetter's incredible sxfr tool:
  http://www.cyd.liu.se/~tompe573/hp/project_sfxr.html 
- Free font from http://www.dafont.com/
- py2exe http://www.py2exe.org/

To run:

- Start ld14.exe
- Or if you have the source distro, run src/ld14.py from the same directory as
  this readme.

How to play:

- Click on four tiles to move them to the slots.
- If the four slots are either all the same shape or all the same color,
  they're removed from play.
- Don't let the wall make it to the bottom of the screen.
- Higher scores for higher tiles or better combinations (all shape/color
  simultaneously). More points at higher levels.

Future stuff:

- Gameplay adjustment. Way too much clicking right now. Is there an easier way
  to do the UI? Also, kind of boring, as expected ("that whole
  making-it-a-good-game thing").
