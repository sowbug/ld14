+00:54 thinking of ideas.
  Anti-Tetris: some other entity is filling in a wall, and your job is to pick it apart.
+01:24 from irc: <sowbug> Okee, here's my idea. Turn Tetris upside-down, completed wall of blocks is moving down (advancing) at you, you form "interesting" sequences of blocks to remove from the wall the lowest blocks composing your sequences. More interesting = more points. Wall hits bottom and you meet your doom.
+02:21 started coding
+02:38 block types: I J L O S T Z (wikipedia)
+11:06 wake up, continue coding after deciding the suckiness of my idea was irrelevant
+13:38 feeling OK about game logic, nearing completion of it
+15:22 creating first alpha distro
