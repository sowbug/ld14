+00:54 thinking of ideas.
  Anti-Tetris: some other entity is filling in a wall, and your job is to pick it apart.
+01:24 from irc: <sowbug> Okee, here's my idea. Turn Tetris upside-down, completed wall of blocks is moving down (advancing) at you, you form "interesting" sequences of blocks to remove from the wall the lowest blocks composing your sequences. More interesting = more points. Wall hits bottom and you meet your doom.
+02:21 started coding
+02:38 block types: I J L O S T Z (wikipedia)
+11:06 wake up, continue coding after deciding the suckiness of my idea was irrelevant
+13:38 feeling OK about game logic, nearing completion of it
+15:22 creating first alpha distro
+18:50 creating second alpha distro
+19:12 showed the game to Thomas (age 4). He watched me play it and then walked away, back to his blocks. :(
+19:36 wish I knew how to draw.
+19:37 Ideas for game:
  - Make each countdown much longer (20 seconds)?
  - More kid-friendly icons. Not letters, but candy canes, carrots, tomatoes, etc.
  - A kind of tile that can be removed only by removing the tiles around it.
  - Better wall-advancement transition that both shows what's happening and addresses the stray-click problem.
  - Better animation that shows how tiles are removed.
  - Restart game at end.
  - Levelling up: when x% of board is gone, increase level?
  - Score: 1 point for low tiles, more for high tiles, multiplier for 4 of both same shape/color
+20:36 Did the smooth wall animation and slowed the game down.
+38:07 Spent about an hour getting py2exe working, which caused some font/icon cleanup.
+38:25 gameinfo.xml
+38:58 fixed a bug reported by klobad.
+38:59 taking a break (actually a shower) to think about gameplay (actually to get clean).
+39:22 thought of game name: Blood on Stair. This rhymes with how I (mis)pronounce Ludum Dare.
+39:27 Flood of Hair.
+40:58 Flood of Air.
+40:58 Preparing new dist with the special tile.
+41:19 Tracking down the perma-x bug.
+41:46 Came up with simple workaround for perma-x. Need to implement something smart to do full rule.
+41:47 Turns out x tiles are fun. Adding them starting at level 2.
